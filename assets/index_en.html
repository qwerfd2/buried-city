Excessive amounts will be converted to equivalent immune time.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">FAQ<button class="button2" onclick="scrollToSection('hub')">Return</button></h2>
    <b>Q: I don't like the design of virus load! Can you make a version without it?</b>
    <p>A: No. Virus Load has been carefully balanced. If you play normally and sacrifice attributes accordingly, It will not be a barrier towards completion. If you want to be invincible, select the cheat talent and heal yourself using Radio CMD.</p>
    <b>Q: What's updated in this version?</b>
    <p>A: A common problem with my personal projects is that I don't do enough documentation. If you ask me what is updated for a specific version, I'm sorry, I don't know. This document is an accurate (?) description of everything that is new.</p>
    <b>Q: Why did you remove character selection and Falcon Bike?</b>
    <p>A: Offical game's design of multiple playable characters is largely profit-driven. Each IAP characters have deadly weaknesses yet contains unique content. Rather than sustaining the poorly thought-out system, I decided to use the exclusive contents to support a cohesive user experience. Falcon was probably designed as an IAP item, and was removed during the designing of Fuel Mechanism due to its conflict with the Mororcycle and general incoherence with the world setting.</p>
    <b>Q: Can you play Buried City on IOS and PC?</b>
    <p>A: Unfortunately, The official version released on these platforms have always been compiled by SpiderMonkey. I cannot obtain the platform-specific part of code, so I cannot make Buried City compatible. You can use Android emulators such as BlueStacks, or purchase an Android device.</p>    
    <b>Q: This game is so hard, I'm always in need of materials! Can you make it easier?</b>
    <p>A: I will rebalance the affected features every time something new is added. As updates have been gradual, I believe the current balance is appropriate. The game is designed to be challenging, as you are in a zombie apocolypse. If you believe that something is not balanced, please let me know - just be ready for my rebuttal.</p>
    <b>Q: Can you add this item, or this location?</b>
    <p>A: Unless the items and locations have new functionality or unique attributes, they will not be added. Adding these things can take a lot of time (photoshopping, translating, balancing, etc). I believe in quality over quantity, so I won't design something if I do not have the willpower needed to do so.</p>
    <b>Q: Can you add more stories to the gameplay?</b>
    <p>A: I have 5+ years of game design experience, and I believe that traditional story structure is incompatible with survival games. It will only divide players - distracting survival-oriented players and barring story-oriented players with survival difficulties. Lore is okay, but unless I have the resource to do branching storyline, any more story will not help with the player experience.</p>
    <b>Q: How do I update the game?</b>
    <p>A: Visit the Rentry post, or GitHub Release, located in Main Menu - Thumb button. Install the downloaded APK and have fun!</p>
    <b>Q: I can write code/make artworks/do QA, is there anything I can help?</b>
    <p>A: There is so much. New functionality, locaion-specific maps like 081, unit testing for bugs... If you are passionate about this game, please contact me.</p>
    <b>Q: I want to make my own mod version, where should I start?</b>
    <p>A: APK is a ZIP file. Take a look inside, all the code is in the js files, easily editable. You can use png for assets, or use TexturePacker to compile spritesheets. I recommend the Diff Folder plugin for VSCode, you can use it to compare code differences between mods. At the end, don't forget to sign the APK using Apktool or MT Manager.</p>
    <b>Q: Can you mod the game according to my specification, or help me crack another game?</b>
    <p>A: No. These requests takes a lot of time to complete. I usually charge people for this, but I don't want to profit from this project. I might be able to help with other games depending on mood.</p>
    <b>Q: I have suggestions, opinions, or other requests. Can I contact you?</b>
    <p>A: Of course. If your questions are unanswered, you are welcomed to contact me through any methods inside Main Menu - Thumb button.</p>

    <p>BuriedTown, originally named BerryTown, was developed by Chengdu 点犀 (DianXi) (Dice7) Network Co.Ltd and published by Beijing 乐动卓越 (LeDongZhuoYue) (Locojoy) Technology Co.Ltd. First launched on the iOS on Sep. 23rd, 2015, The game started its Android beta phase on Sep. 25th, 2015, and was released at Google Play on Nov. 23rd, 2015. The last update (1.4.3) was released on Jun. 27th, 2018, and the game server was shut down around late June, 2019.</p><p>
    Thanks to the game's weak online dependency, the majority of the functionality can be enjoyed offline, with the exception of leaderboards, In-App Purchases, and in-game radio.</p><p>
    Developed using Cocos2d-JS, the installation package of Buried Town is unprotected, source code not compiled nor obfuscated, making modifications extremely easy. Although the graphics have been encrypted, the process after obtaining the key (B29B3886-543224E4-71BDF6E3-9275C626) and edit tool (TexturePacker) is trivial (The encryption has been removed in this version). The game's save file is stored under root-only directory using an encrypted sqlite3 database, with the password (1a2b3c4d5fberrytown).</p>
