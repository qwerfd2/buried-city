<h2>Buried Town Factsheet</h2>
<p>
Buried Town, originally named Berry Town, was developed by Chengdu DianXi (Dice7) Network Co.Ltd and published by Beijing LeDongZhuoYue (Locojoy) Technology Co.Ltd. The game started its beta phase on Sep. 25th, 2015, and was released at Google Play on Nov. 23rd, 2015. The last update (1.4.3) was released on Jun. 27th, 2018, and the game server was shut down around late June, 2019.<br>
Thanks to the game's weak online dependency, the majority of the functionality can be enjoyed offline, with the exception of leaderboards, In-App Purchases, and in-game radio.<br>
Developed using Cocos2d-JS, the installation package of Buried Town is unprotected, source code not compiled nor obfuscated, making modifications extremely easy. Although the graphics have been encrypted, the process after obtaining the key (B29B3886543224E471BDF6E39275C626) and edit tool (TexturePacker) is trivial.<br>
The game's save file is stored under root-only directory using an encrypted sqlite3 database, with the password (1a2b3c4d5fberrytown).
